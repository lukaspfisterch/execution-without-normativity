\section{Scope and Non-Goals}

This paper defines a minimal theory of deterministic execution and observation. It deliberately excludes any notion of normativity, governance, or domain meaning. The model is structural and is intended to support precise replay and audit of execution structure without interpretation.

\paragraph{Out of scope.}
The following are explicitly excluded:
\begin{itemize}
  \item policy, governance, or decision logic
  \item application semantics or correctness
  \item alignment, safety, or ethical evaluation
  \item post-execution filtering as a control mechanism
  \item distributed consensus, fault tolerance, or availability guarantees
  \item side-channel resistance or covert channel analysis
\end{itemize}

The theory addresses execution order and observational separation only.

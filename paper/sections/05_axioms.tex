\section{Axioms}

We state five axioms that characterize deterministic execution and observational separation.

\paragraph{A1 Atomicity of $\Delta$.}
Execution is composed of atomic events. No event can be partially applied or split into smaller execution units for the purposes of ordering or replay.

\paragraph{A2 Append-only ordered stream $V$.}
The execution stream $V$ is append-only and totally ordered by the index $t(e)$. Events are immutable once appended.

\paragraph{A3 Order is independent of wall clock time.}
The order induced by $t$ is defined by stream position only. Wall clock time is observational and does not affect order.

\paragraph{A4 Observations are non-derivational.}
Observations may be recorded and may vary arbitrarily. The canonical projection $\pi(V)$ must not depend on observations. Changes in observations alone cannot change $\pi(V)$.

\paragraph{A5 Structural determinism of projections.}
For fixed authoritative execution inputs $I_{\text{exec}}$, the canonical projection $\pi(V; I_{\text{exec}})$ is deterministic and invariant under execution replay. Authoritative execution inputs are those required to identify and order events in $V$ and to evaluate $\pi$; observational artifacts are excluded.

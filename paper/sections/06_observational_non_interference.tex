\section{Observational Non-Interference}

We formalize the separation between observation and deterministic projection. Let $V$ be an execution stream and let $O$ be the set of observations attached to events. Two executions are observation-equivalent if they have identical ordered event sequences and differ only in observations.

\paragraph{Definition.}
For execution streams $V$ and $V'$, we write $V \sim_O V'$ if they contain the same ordered sequence of events and differ only in observation artifacts. A projection $\pi$ is observation-free if $V \sim_O V'$ implies $\pi(V) = \pi(V')$.

\paragraph{Lemma.}
Under A4 and A5, the canonical projection $\pi$ is observation-free. Therefore, changing observations does not change deterministic projections.

\paragraph{Corollary.}
Observation does not interfere with deterministic reconstruction. Observations can be recorded, but they do not define or alter the deterministic structure of execution.

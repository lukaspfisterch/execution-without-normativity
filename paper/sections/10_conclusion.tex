\section{Conclusion}

We presented a minimal axiomatic theory of deterministic execution and observation without normativity. The theory defines atomic events, an append-only ordered stream, and observation as a non-derivational artifact. Under the axioms, canonical projections are deterministic, observation-free, and replayable. The result is a structural notion of determinism that is independent of outcome meaning or domain semantics.

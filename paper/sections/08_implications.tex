\section{Implications}

The model provides a minimal substrate for deterministic execution structure and observational separation. It can support systems that need replayable execution structure without introducing meaning, normativity, or governance. The implications are structural rather than semantic: execution order is explicit, observation is isolated, and deterministic projections are stable under replay.

\section{Implications}

The model provides a minimal substrate for deterministic execution structure and observational separation. It can support systems that need replayable execution structure without introducing meaning, normativity, or governance. Event sourcing provides historical context for ordered event reconstruction, but the present model is intentionally narrower and avoids domain semantics \cite{fowler2005event}. The implications are structural rather than semantic: execution order is explicit, observation is isolated, and deterministic projections are stable under replay.

\paragraph{Comparison to related formalisms.}
Event sourcing treats events as domain-level changes and typically embeds meaning into event content, while this model treats events as structure and removes domain semantics from projection \cite{fowler2005event}. Formal specification approaches such as TLA+ model state transitions and temporal properties, whereas this model isolates order and replay without committing to state semantics \cite{lamport2002specifying}. Classical noninterference focuses on preventing forbidden information flow between security domains, while this model treats observations as non-derivational inputs by construction and focuses on structural determinism \cite{goguen1982security,rushby1992noninterference}.

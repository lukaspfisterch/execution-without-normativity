\section{Limitations}

The theory does not claim correctness or meaning of execution outcomes. It does not provide any policy or governance logic. It does not address side channels, distributed consensus, or fault tolerance. It does not constrain execution behavior beyond structural ordering and observational separation. Runtime verification approaches are out of scope and are not modeled here \cite{leucker2009brief}.

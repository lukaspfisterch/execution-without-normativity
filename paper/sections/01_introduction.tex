\section{Introduction}

Deterministic execution is often discussed as a property of outcomes. This view conflates execution with meaning and treats observational artifacts as if they were part of the execution structure. When observational changes are allowed to influence deterministic projections, replay and audit cease to be reliable.

This paper introduces a minimal axiomatic model that separates execution structure from observation without introducing normativity. The goal is to define what it means for an execution to be deterministic in a structural sense, independent of any domain semantics. The model is intentionally small and focuses on order, replay, and explicit treatment of observations.

We present formal foundations, axioms, and proof sketches of observational non-interference and replay equivalence. The results are purely structural and apply to any system that can produce an ordered stream of execution events.
